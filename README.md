Regular solder paste dispensers must be connected to compressed air which you can provide with huge compressor. As a maker I can not run a large compressor in my room because of its noise and footprint.

Stencils might be a solution but for small size PCB work they are too dirty and I don't like to touch the chemical solder paste with my hands and tools. It takes more time to clean up every time than apply it to the PCB.

That's why I decided to design a desktop solder paste dispenser that is clean, easy to use and small in size. I call it Solderocket.

Using the rotary knobs, the time and pressure can be set so that the right dot size can be selected for each type of solder paste.

This device is indispensable when working with SMD on a regular basis. SMD paste can be dosed very accurately and quickly. Adhesives can be used in addition to SMD paste.
